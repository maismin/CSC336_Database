|      2 | The book content is good but the price is absurd. You can find all of this information online for free, or if you want it condensed in a book, find a cheaper   alternative. I was able to find similar content in other used database textbooks for $10. I'm upset because I would have kept this book if not for that absurd/insulting price. |
